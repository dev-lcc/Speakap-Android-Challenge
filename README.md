# Introduction 
This project represents a technical challenge.  

The conditions are described in a separate document. This is a short summary.

# Summary   
Create an app using the Rijksmuseum API to display items from the museum's collection. We're providing you with a working sample app that needs to be improved. 

Get an API key for the Rijksmuseum API: https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/ or http://rijksmuseum.github.io/

# Specification
The app should consist of three screens:

-  An initial screen with a list of the items in Rijksmuseum's collection.
-  A screen with details of a certain item of the collection.  
   This screen is accessed when an item of the initial screen is tapped.  
   What details to display is up to you (for instance: author, year of creation, etc.)  
-  A screen listing items that share the same characteristic.  
   This screen is accessed when one of the details in the item detail screen is tapped. For instance, when the user taps the author name, this screen should show a list of all items created by the same author.  
   You don't have to make every detail clickable, just pick one or two.
